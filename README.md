# AndroidNumberApp
This app is designed to be a one stop shop for all things you may want to do with numbers. Includes random number generator, calculator, and data set manipulations.

## First version
  A random number generator. User can select the range the random number is selected from, with a floor of 1 and up to a ceiling of 10.
  
  The code and idea for this was based on this YouTube video by TreeHouse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOfCEhWq8sg&t=255s
  
## Second version

  The second version will include a calculator. A Home screen will be implemented to be able to choose between the calculator and the random number generator. 
  
## Third version

  This will be the biggest version. Here the user will be able to enter in a set of numbers, and then the app will be able to calculate mean, median, mode, range, and maybe matrix multiplication. That might be for another version however. 
  
## Fourth version

Maybe some UI work, make it look like more than a basic Android app.
